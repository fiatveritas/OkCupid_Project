      " single guy, looking for other single guys who are interested in meeting and seeing how things evolve.  i was born and brought up abroad. i have been a traveler most of life, moving every few years to a different city. i enjoy traveling and visiting places in new countries. it has been over two years since i moved to san francisco from upstate ny, and i really like it here. sometimes, i wonder if it is time to stop moving and just continue living here. i enjoy meeting new people and hearing their stories. i also enjoy spending time talking / hearing about / understanding different cultures. needless to say, that has shaped my outlook of the world around us. i am fairly liberal (politically speaking) and like to follow things in the news that are currently shaping the world.  i am a scientist (research / biotech) by profession and i really like what i do.    i eat well (mostly) and work out 2-4 times a week to keep fit and healthy. i really enjoy good food, and can be quite critical (and comical..) in rating food at restaurants.    i am pretty happy with my life, and would love to meet someone special (for lack of a better word.) to share it with. intelligence is sexy. nice-ness is attractive. playfulness is desirable. \n",

      "i don't take myself or life very seriously. life is just more fun when being silly and crazy! i adore my friends and family and especially being an \"auntie.\" whenever i have extra money, i am off traveling - next on the agenda is alaska and yellowstone as well as more adventures in europe and central america. i thoroughly enjoy riding my bike to park chalet for a beer, dancing in the kitchen, eating ice cream, watching movies in dolores park and sleeping in. i occasionally rock climb and play soccer but brunch and bloody marys seem to be winning out these days! i sometimes come home all giggly from the bar, am a surprisingly decent poker player, and keep trader joe's frozen food department in business. i try to go \"glamping\" a couple times a year and yosemite is just about my favorite place (tied with paris). i've been here in san francisco 6+ years and love that i have found home!    i grew up in mi and would like to think i am a nice midwestern gal... though never plan to experience those winters again. a yearly trip home to enjoy my dad's delicious garden in the summer and see my feisty grandmas is lovely and makes me appreciate my upbringing.    i'm looking for someone who has a relaxed positive outlook on life, loves to laugh and goof around. he enjoys the unexpected, is up for checking out all of the local festivals and street fairs, recycles (with bonus points for composting), leads an active life and is an excellent cook of crispy bacon.    interests:  book club, camping, dining out, movies/videos, exploring new areas, playing cards, travel/sightseeing, volunteering, watching soccer, walking / hiking, backgammon, trivia night \n",
